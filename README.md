# ❌⭕ X-O Game (Tic-Tac-Toe) - Java CLI Version

Welcome to the X-O Game (also known as Tic-Tac-Toe), a fully interactive two-player command-line game written in Java. This game was built as a practice project to reinforce Java fundamentals, logical thinking, and clean code structure.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**X-O Game** is a classic 3x3 grid game where two players (X and O) take turns marking a space. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a row — vertically, horizontally, or diagonally — wins. If the board is filled with no winner, the game ends in a draw.

This version is entirely **terminal-based (CLI)** and focuses on clear logic, clean user interaction, and simple game mechanics.

## 🎯 Key Features

- Two-player mode (X vs O)
- Real-time game board rendering in the terminal
- Input validation (prevents invalid or duplicate moves)
- Win and draw detection logic
- Clean and modular Java code
- Game replay support *(optional in code)*
- Lightweight and fast — no external dependencies

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
- This project was designed to practice and apply:
- Python basics: variables, loops, lists, functions
- Modular programming
- User input handling with input()
- Conditional logic and decision structures
- Building terminal-based applications

## 🎮 Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Player X goes first.
- Players take turns choosing a cell (1-9).
- A player wins if they place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
- If all cells are filled with no winner, the game ends in a draw.
